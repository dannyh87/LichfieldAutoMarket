# COVID Queue manager

A small client server application to allow a queue or pool of customers to be served by multiple service points, sequentially.

The project consists of a node.JS server 
with three endpoints to allow manipulation of and fetching from the queue

Two web pages allow:
1) The "Next" customer(s) to be displayed - along with the service point they should attend
2) A simple UI for the service agents to summon the next customer
